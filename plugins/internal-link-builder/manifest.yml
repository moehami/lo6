# The following build event hooks tell Netlify when to run your plugin.
# `onPostBuild` is perfect for this as it happens after your site is generated.
# For more info on hooks, see: https://docs.netlify.com/extend/develop-and-share/events-lifecycle/
#
# If you wanted to do something *before* the build, you could use `onPreBuild`
# instead, for example.
#
# This file is also where you would specify any configuration inputs, but
# this plugin doesn't need any.
