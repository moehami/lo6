Such stores sell the returned, overstocked, and liquidated products of big retailers like Amazon; these products are usually kept in big bins or on tables, and their prices drop slightly every day during the week.

The lure is in the unpredictable inventory and the thrill of spotting a high-value item for a fraction of its retail price, where some stores even sell items for as low as $1-$3 by the end of the weekly cycle.
