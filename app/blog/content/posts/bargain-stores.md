Bargain bin Amazon - that mysterious corner of the online retail giant where deals lurk and thrifty shoppers rejoice. Unlike traditional clearance aisles, Amazon's bargains are scattered across multiple platforms in their realm.

The Amazon Warehouse Deals category is perhaps the most popular destination for deals, offering open-box and returned items at deep discounts. Items range from "like new" with damaged boxes to "acceptable" with cosmetic flaws but are all inspected and functional.

And then there's Amazon Outlet, a dedicated store for overstock and clearance sales by product category from electronics to clothing. It's outlet mall shopping on the internet without ever getting up from your couch.

Lightning deals and daily deals are time-sensitive discounts that play on the thrill factor in every budget shopper. They're only available for a limited time, so they're a rush but can provide significant savings to the observant.

For the true adventurers, Amazon's "Under $10" and "Add-on Items" sections reveal hidden gems at cellar prices. Even individual items look small, they are huge value for daily essentials.

What distinguishes Amazon's bargain strategy is its algorithmic underpinning â€“ bargains are suited to browsing and purchasing history. This creates a treasure hunt atmosphere in which each customer's bargain bin experience is uniquely their own, rendering bargain shopping a personalized experience.
