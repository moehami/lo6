The thought might have crossed your mind: Where do all those returned Amazon packages go? You know, those things somebody impulsively ordered, then sent back because the color was "not exactly right" or just because they changed their minds. Well, of course, they don't just vaporize into the thin air! In fact, many of them are sold into what savvy shoppers refer to as "overstock bins," and these bins are transforming the way those with a tight budget shop.

## What Exactly Are Overstock Bins?

Overstock bins (sometimes referred to as liquidation bins or Amazon return bins) are large containers filled with returned merchandise or surplus goods that retailers sell at steep discounts. These modern-day treasure chests have started to sprout all over strip malls and shopping centers across the country, attracting quite the following of bargain hunters.

Really, it's a fairly simple concept: The big-name retailers like Amazon, Target, Walmart return items that need to be quickly liquidated. Instead of spending time and money inspecting, refashioning, and restocking each item, they sell their return merchandise in bulk to the liquidators, who then make it available to the public via these bin-stores.

Here's the thing: Shopping overstock bins is not just about the thrifty factor (though, there is a lot of that). It is about the excitement of discovery, the rush of stumbling upon something unexpected; this is almost like gambling, but with much better odds.

## The Bin Shopping Experience

Walking into an overstock bin store is uncommon for a retail experience. Forget neatly set shelves and helpful staff ready to answer your queries. These places are usually no-frills warehouses with bins (sometimes actual bins, sometimes tables, or shelves) full of merchandise.

Many stores run "bin day" promotions in which all merchandize is put into the bins for fresh inventory and high prices-about $10 or $15 per item. Prices then gradually come down each day, reaching a bottom on the fourth day or so at $1 or $2 per item. And then they begin the cycle all over again.

I recall my first experience going to a bin store- I was there on a Tuesday, and it was still $8 per item (rookie mistake). The selection was decent until I came back on Friday for the $2 day, when it was absolute mayhem! People would line up before opening time, with gloves on and even headlamps at occasion. It felt much more posterior diggery than shopping.

## The Crowd for Bins

Overstock shoppers turn out to be a surprisingly diverse population. They are:

* Young parents buying toys and baby gear
* Students buying cheap things for their apartments
* Resellers trying to buy items that they can sell at a small profit
* Hobbyists looking for particular collectibles or electronics
* The average Joe after a bargain

The one thing that brings these folks together is the thrill of searching followed by the high of uncovering present-day loot for a fraction of its original value.

## The Good, The Bad, and The Unexpected

Let's be honest; not everyone is cut out for bin shopping. It has its charms and annoyances, so be warned in advance.

### The Good Stuff

Potentially huge cash savings! Items worthwhile for hundreds of dollars are found there for just a few bucks practically every other day. Shoppers have seen brand-new Dyson vacuums, Apple watches, and high-end kitchen appliances sold for pennies on the dollar literally.

There's a certain satisfaction that comes from giving an item a second chance to be used by someone; rather than returned items getting dumped in landfills, they find homes. Environmentalism while shopping; how about that for an idea?

And of course, becoming part of the bin shopping fraternity is always fun to talk about. Bin shoppers with some regularity get to learn about one another, share tips, and congratulate each other on good finds; it is basically a modern treasure hunting club.

## Tips for Successful Bin Shopping

Here are some tips for prospective bin shoppers from the seasoned ones:

1. **Keep an eye out for store schedules.** Depending on when the bins are restocked, prices may vary.
2. **Dress accordingly.** Gloves are useful (you really do not want to know what anybody has been handling or if there might have been a mess), and portable chargers come in handy for testing items.
3. **Have a budget.** Low prices can be deceptive; it's easy to go wild and fill your car with $2 items that eventually may add up.
4. **Inspect!** Open boxes if applicable, test all functions, or check for damages before buying.
5. **Go with your mind set.** Having some sort of mental checklist is useful to help you stay concentrated and not lose focus from the ocean of inventory.
6. **Prepare to walk away empty-handed.** Some days nothing in the bins will suit your needs, and that is perfectly OK.

## Beyond the Bins: The Bigger Picture

The rise of overstock bin shops could point to some interesting changes in our consumer culture. Online shopping has really hit an all-time high and with e-commerce, return rates are way larger than for brick and mortar purchases. So, you have a lot of items looking for good homes.

# Is It Worth Bin Shopping?

The value of overstock bin shopping depends completely on what you value. If you enjoy the treasure hunt, do not mind chaotic conditions, and have the patience to sort items, then surely the potential rewards are worth it.

If your shopping prefers predictability with guarantees and customer service, you will still want to stick to the usual retailing.

Me? I've grown into a full-blown convert for bin shopping. Nothing beats the joy of finding just what you needed (or something you really didn't know you wanted) at a fraction of the cost. Added to that are the tales of your journey: like the time I bought a $300 espresso machine for $5 that needed a good cleaning-down.

In the end, overstock bins speak much louder than just a discounted price tag. They remind us that certain returned items are treasures for some, that shopping could still be an adventure, and that sometimes, some of the best deals come with a pinch of uncertainty.

Next time you see a sign advertising "Amazon returns" or "Overstock bins," try to stop by. It's all about half the joy of wondering what you are going to discover.
