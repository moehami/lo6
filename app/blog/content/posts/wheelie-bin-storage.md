Wheelie bins are important waste management tools, but they can become an eyesore when not properly stored. The best wheelie bin storage ensures an orderly property while keeping your bins available during collection time. This guide will take you through the entire process of creating and maintaining an ideal wheelie bin storage.
What is Wheelie Bin Storage?
Wheelie bin storage denotes areas, structures, or systems designed to accommodate your waste and recycling bins when they are not in use. Instead of simply leaving them scattered around the property, proper wheelie bin storage provides a dedicated space to contain, organize, and hide the bins. Proper wheelie bin storage can be anything from areas simply assigned for bin placement to constructible enclosures or screens for hiding your bins from view, while still allowing ease of access for you and for waste collection services.
Why Is Storage So Important for Wheelie Bins?

Improve Property Appearance
This option is by far the most apparent benefit of wheelie bin storage. Randomly placed bins all over your property might tarnish the beautiful upkeep of any home. Through a designated storage space, curb appeal of the home is automatically heightened for a cleaner appearance.
Stopping Bin Migration
Without proper wheelie bin storage, bins will easily migrate around your property, primarily on windy days or after collection. This could cause hazards or block pathways or just irritate the neighbors when bins turn up in unfavourable locations.
Reduces Pest Problems
Wheelie bin storage that is properly enclosed keeps waste away from animals. Rats, foxes, cats, and birds are much less likely to scatter rubbish when bins are stored in secure and covered areas.
Protect the Bins from Weather Conditions
A secure wheelie bin storage protects your bins against harsh weather conditions. It prevents bins from sun degradation, ice formation during winter, or from getting blown away during some storms.
Maintains Hygiene
It is much easier to clean and maintain designated wheelie bin storage than to have the bins scattered in various locations. This will reduce the building-up of grime, odor, and bacteria around your premises.
Choosing Your Wheelie Bin Storage
Assess Your Space
Start by measuring the area where you plan to create your wheelie bin storage. Consider how many bins you need to store and ensure there's free space for maneuverability. Remember that wheelie bin storage areas need access not only for daily use but also collection days.
Consider Budget Implications
The solutions offered for wheelie bin storage range between free DIY options to costly custom solutions. Establish your budget before considering options that are within your price range.
Think Materials
Different materials offer different degrees of durability, maintenance requirements, and aesthetic appeal. Wood lends a natural look to something but requires maintenance from time to time. Metal is durable but maybe prone to rusting. Plastic is maintenance-free but might not really match the style of your property.
Planning for Accessibility
You must assure that the wheelie bin storage remains accessible on rubbish collection days. There must be sufficient space for collection crews to move the bins to the curbside and return to storage comfortably. Consider the path from storage to collection point in your design.
Useful Wheelie Bin Storage Solutions
Simple Screening Solutions
One of the cheapest ways of storing wheelie bins is to build a screen to hide the bins from view. This could be by means of using fence panels, lattice screens, or bespoke bin screens. These set-ups work well when you are crammed for space or are working to a tight budget.
Bin Storage Sheds
Bin storage sheds offer total concealment and protection from the elements. Mostly these are fitted with hinged lids or front-opening doors allowing easy access to the bins for everyday use while keeping them fully hidden from view.
DIY Enclosures
Building your own wheelie bin storage enclosure allows you to tailor it to the style of your property as well as your specific needs. Some popular DIY variations include wooden pallet constructions, brick-built enclosures, or a combination of different materials.
Designated Storage Areas
Sometimes the best wheelie bin storage solution is simply designating a special area of your property for bins. This might include building a concrete pad, erecting some boundary markers, or implementing clear policies regarding where bins should be placed.
Wheelie Bin Storage Tips
Label Everything Clearly
If you have multiple bins for different types of waste, clear labeling guarantees proper use and quick make collection time. Use weather-proof labels or paint directly onto your bins to ensure the marks will be visible over time.
Create Systems for Collection Days
Set up a system that requires moving the bins from the storage area to the collection point. Consider having a trolley for easy conveyance, or having a clear path to make this task quick. Some people also find it useful to have their phone set up with reminders for preparing on collection days.
Establish Household Rules
Ensure that everyone in the household knows the wheelie bin storage system: what goes in which bins, how to close the storage doors or lids correctly, and when they have to be moved for collection.
Plan for Different Bin Sizes
Most households typically have bins of different sizes for different types of waste. Make sure your wheelie bin storage can take into account these size differences without losing organization or ease of access.
