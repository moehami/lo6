Looking for bargain bins near me has become somewhat of a treasure hunt in recent years, as savvy shoppers want to get the best deal possible in their local area.

## What Are Bargain Bins?

Bargain bins are special areas within stores or independent discount outlets in which retailers sell merchandise at deeply discounted prices. These bins, also sometimes known as clearance bins or discount bins, are typically filled with overstock items, seasonal merchandise, discontinued products, or items with slight damage to their packaging. While the term "bin" may bring to mind an image of a disorganized container, many bargain sections today are neatly arranged and thoughtfully merchandised.
