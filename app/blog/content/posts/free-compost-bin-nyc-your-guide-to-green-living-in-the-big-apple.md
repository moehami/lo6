## Types of Bins Offered

Composting programs in New York City typically offer a few types of bins. Tumbler bins are ideal for tiny places and help the breakdown process. Traditional dumpsters are ideal for traditionalists who have enough space and time. Kitchen compost bins allow you to collect wastes in the kitchen before transporting them to your primary bin. Worm composting bins are perhaps the best choice for apartment residents. These compact indoor devices produce nutrient-rich compost quickly. Many New York City free compost bin programs feature worm bins designed for urban living.

## Making the Most of Your Compost

Composting is fundamentally about balance and patience. Remember that your bin should contain green materials—such as vegetable scraps or coffee grounds, which are rich in nitrogen—and brown materials—carbon-rich items like dry leaves or paper.

Keep the compost moist but not overly saturated; turn it occasionally to aerate the decomposition process. Meat, dairy products, oils, and pet waste should not be included in the bin, as these items can create significant disturbances and complications due to their presence.

Stay on the easier side at the beginning and learn composting gradually. Even a free compost bin NYC is pleased to provide requires some intention and improvisation for success. If your first batch was less than perfect, don't feel discouraged; one strengthens their composting skills through practice.

# Composting Complete Q\&A Guide

## What are the materials that go into a compost bin?

In general, a compost bin is supposed to contain an equal balance of green and brown materials. Green materials are high in nitrogen: Fresh kitchen scraps including vegetable peels, fruit scraps, coffee grounds, tea bags, fresh grass clippings, et cetera. Brown materials, on the other hand, land on the rich carbon side of things: dry leaves, newspapers, cardboards, paper towels, dry plant materials.

Three parts of brown materials should ideally go with one part of green materials. The imbalanced condition will give microorganisms the wrong environment for their work in breaking down the matter. Water needs to be pared into the pile from time to time to keep it moist, never soggy.

## How to compost?

Making compost is pretty simple. First of all, choose a site for the compost pile that offers some sun and has drainage. Begin with a bottom layer made from coarse brown materials such as twigs or shredded cardboard, which will allow for good air circulation.

Next, layer green materials with their brown complimentary alternates, with each layer being approximately 4-6" thick. Water each layer so it feels damp to a wrung-out sponge. Turn the pile every two to four weeks after about a month to add oxygen that speeds decomposition. Depending on the conditions and maintenance, you can have fertilizer within three to twelve months.
What should be added to compost bin at the start?
At the start of filling a compost bin, you gather green materials and brown materials. Start with dry brown materials, such as shredded newspaper, dry leaves, or small cardboard pieces, as the initial base layer. Then put in your green materials, which can be vegetable scraps, fruit peels, or coffee grounds.
Throw in a shovel full of finished compost or garden soil to bring in microorganisms that will speed up the process of decomposition. In the absence of finished compost, do not panic, the process will still work, but just slower. Add water to make sure that moisture levels are adequate.

Whats' Not To Compost:
Meat and fish scraps - Attracts pests and causes odor
Dairy products - Become rancid and attract undesired animals
Oils and fats - Decomposition slows while pests are encouraged
Pet waste - Contains harmful bacteria and parasites
Diseased plants - Spread plant disease through finished compost
Weeds with seed - Seeds might survive and spread on application of compost
Treated wood or sawdust - Might contain chemicals
Coal or charcoal ash - Contains substances harmful to plants
Glossy or coated paper - Contain chemicals that don't readily break down
Synthetic materials - Plastics, metals and synthetic fabrics won't decompose
Large branches - Too slow to break down without shredding
Citrus peels in large quantities - Too acidic and might hamper decomposition
Onions and garlic scraps - Might inhibit useful organisms in your compost pile
