## Types of Bins in Matthews

### Residential Waste Bins

The Town delivers strong, wheeled trash bins for all your trash day needs. These bins are available in different sizes to cater to various household requirements:

These single-stream recycling containers belong to the family that recycles paper, cardboard, plastic bottles, glass containers, and aluminum cans. No sorting needed! Just give them a quick rinse and chuck them into the bin.

### Yard Waste Bins

Living in Matthews means enjoying wonderfully majestic trees and landscaping all year round. The town provides brown yard waste bins for grass clippings, leaves, small branches, and other organic garden waste.
