Ever spotted someone wearing designer clothing and wondered how they can possibly afford it? Well, here's a little secret – they might be savvy thrift shoppers. High-end thrifting has become huge over the past few years, and honestly, it's changing the way many of us think about fashion and home decor overall.

## Beyond Your Grandma's Thrift Shop

Let's be real – when someone mentions "thrift store," what comes to mind? Musty rooms filled with outdated clothes and chipped dishes? Well, throw that mental image right out the window. Today's high-end thrift stores are nothing like the cluttered charity shops of yesteryear.

Modern upscale thrift stores – occasionally called consignment boutiques or resale boutiques – are patient in choosing what they offer for sale. They are picky about what makes the cut onto their racks and shelves. Some even have strict acceptance policies, accepting only the best by high-end designers.

"The first time that I ever went to a designer consignment store, I couldn't believe my eyes," recalls Melissa, a native Bostonian turned thrift shopper. "I bought a barely worn Burberry trench coat for $85 that would have cost well over $1,000 if it were brand new. Addicted from day one!"

## Why High-End Thrifting Has Taken Off

So what's behind the thrifting mania? Various factors have combined to make it the perfect storm:

Sustainability concerns have pushed most consumers to consider secondhand first. The eco-footprint of fast fashion becomes increasingly impossible to ignore, and buying second-hand keeps good things from filling up landfills.

Economic considerations play a significant role as well. Who wouldn't wish to look like a million dollars without spending nearly that much? With inflation tightening wallets, more and more consumers are looking for creative ways to stretch their dollars.

Social media has also made thrifting a fashionable hobby that's popularized far and wide. Influencers share their "thrift hauls" every day, showing incredible treasures and inspiring millions to shop at thrift stores.

## How to Find Hidden Gems Near You

Discovering these treasure troves isn't always a straightforward process. Unlike big retail chains, upscale thrift stores often don't have enormous advertising budgets. They're sometimes hidden in plain sight, wedged between other shops or in nondescript neighborhoods.

Here are some proven ways to locate them:

Attempt to search on the internet with targeted terms such as "designer consignment," "luxury resale," or "high-end thrift" and your location. This yields more targeted results than just searching for "thrift stores."

Inquire with hip friends where they go to thrift. Word of mouth remains prevalent in thrifty groups, and word of mouth will usually yield the best-kept secrets.

Search social media, especially Instagram and Facebook. A few high-end thrift stores have lively pages where they list new stock and limited-time sales.

Look on resale apps like Mercari or Poshmark, then follow up with sellers on whether they carry a physical storefront. Most online sellers also maintain brick-and-mortar stores.

"I found my favorite of all time upscale thrift store by accident from a compliment at a coffee shop," says Carlos, a self-touted Chicago thrifter. "This lady was complimenting me on my jacket, and I told her that it was a thrift, and she just told me her little secret. That store has been a favorite of mine for three years now!"

## So What Makes a "High-End" Thrift Shop, Anyway?

Not all secondhand shops are created equal. A few characteristics distinguish truly upscale thrift shops from run-of-the-mill resale shops:

Their inventory focuses on designer and high-end brands. Yes, you might find the occasional Target score, but the racks actually do contain recognized luxury brands.

Quality control is strict. Most pieces have little wear and tear, and most still have tags attached to them from when they left the factory. Stains, tears, or evidence

## High-End Thrift Store FAQs

### What is considered a high-end thrift store?

A high-end thrift store, also known as a consignment boutique or high-end resale shop, is a boutique that sells top-quality, designer, and luxury brand merchandise at discounted prices. In contrast to other thrift shops, these boutiques painstakingly sort through their merchandise, typically only taking in high-quality pieces in near-new condition. They carry brands you'd see in department stores and designer boutiques, have a more upscale shopping atmosphere with neat displays, and usually have educated sales staff who can authenticate luxury items. Prices are higher than at average thrift shops, but less than at retail.

### Where can I find luxury thrift stores?

Upscale thrift stores typically are found in upscale neighborhoods, shopping districts, and higher-income zip codes. Search online using terms like "designer consignment," "luxury resale," or "upscale thrift store" and your city or zip code. Social media, especially Instagram, are excellent resources since upscale thrift stores tend to list their items online. Yelp and Google Maps apps allow you to look up reviews from other consumers. Additionally, fashion-forward cities like New York, Los Angeles, Chicago, Miami, and San Francisco will typically have numerous high-end thrift shops.

### Is Buffalo Exchange high-end?

Buffalo Exchange falls within a middle tier between low-end thrift stores and high-end consignment shops. Buffalo Exchange is not technically high-end but does carry some designer and high-end brands as well as generic ones. Their buying is selective, geared towards trendy and quality products over strictly designer labels. The inventory by store is vastly different—the stores in trendier or richer areas have higher-end brands. Buffalo Exchange can only be likened to a tastefully curated used store who, at times, has the high-end leftovers at bargain prices along with their more mainstream fare.

### What is the difference between a thrift store and a consignment store?

The primary difference between thrift stores and consignment stores is their business model and source of inventory. Thrift stores primarily sell donated items, with proceeds frequently going to charitable causes. They typically accept large quantities of items regardless of brand or condition. Consignment stores, however, sell for the individual owner, sharing the profit when products are sold (usually 40-60% to the original owner). Consignment stores are pickier, only taking products with high quality and fashion standards. They typically have higher-end merchandise, more boutique-like shopping ambiances, and prices than an average thrift store.

### What is the best day to go thrift shopping?

The absolute best thrift store shopping day can vary from store to store but does follow general trends. Most of the high-end consignment and thrift stores restock on either a Wednesday or a Thursday before weekend traffic. Monday morning can offer
